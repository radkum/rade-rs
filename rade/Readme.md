# RADE — Real-time Analysis & Deobfuscation Engine

## Overview
**RADE** (Real-time Analysis & Deobfuscation Engine) is a powerful, high-performance pattern matching and evaluation engine designed to analyze AMSI (Antimalware Scan Interface) events in real time. RADE focuses on detecting, decoding, and deobfuscating malicious or suspicious scripts and payloads by applying advanced pattern matching techniques and heuristics.

RADE is built to empower security analysts, malware researchers, and endpoint protection solutions with rapid, accurate insights into potentially harmful code execution within Windows environments.
